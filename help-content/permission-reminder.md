# ðŸ”„ Terminal Command Reminder

I can run bash commands in two ways:

## Option 1: Dedicated Tmux Pane (Recommended)  
- **Benefits**: Shared context, long-running command support, debugging capability
- **Usage**: `execute_terminal_command "your-command"`

## Option 2: Direct Bash (Limited)
- **Benefits**: Simple, immediate
- **Limitations**: No shared context, long commands block conversation

**Would you like me to use the dedicated tmux pane for all terminal commands?**
This enables better collaboration and debugging support.

Reply **"yes"** to enable shared terminal mode, or **"no"** to continue with case-by-case decisions.
