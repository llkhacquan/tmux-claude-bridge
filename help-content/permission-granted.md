# âœ… Shared Terminal Mode Enabled

Perfect! I'll now run all bash commands through the dedicated tmux pane.

## What this means:
- **All commands**: `ls`, `git status`, `make check`, etc. â†’ go through MCP
- **Shared context**: We both see the same command history and output
- **Long tasks**: Automatically go to background monitoring  
- **No more blocking**: Builds/tests won't interrupt our conversation

## Ready to use:
- I'll proactively run commands when helpful
- You can ask "what went wrong?" and I'll check the terminal history
- Long tasks will show progress via `get_command_status`

**Shared terminal mode is now active!** ðŸš€
