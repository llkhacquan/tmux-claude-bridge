# Tmux Terminal MCP - User Guide

## Quick Start (Zero Setup Required!)

### 1. Start Claude
When you start a fresh Claude session, the MCP automatically announces itself to Claude:
```
ðŸ’¡ Claude: I have loaded the Tmux Terminal MCP for shared command execution.
    Use get_terminal_status or any MCP tool to see the setup guide and permission request.
```

### 2. Claude Sees the Announcement
Claude automatically knows the MCP is available and will proactively offer to use it.

### 3. First Interaction
When Claude first uses any MCP tool, you'll see:
- ðŸŽ¯ **Auto-help guide** explaining the two key benefits
- ðŸ¤” **Permission request**: "Should I run ALL terminal commands through the dedicated tmux pane?"

### 4. Give Permission
Reply **"yes"** to enable shared terminal mode. Claude will then:
- âœ… Automatically use the MCP for all bash commands
- âœ… Never block on long-running tasks (make, npm install, etc.)
- âœ… Be able to debug your terminal issues by reading command history
